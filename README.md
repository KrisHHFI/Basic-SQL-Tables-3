## About
- This project continues on from part [1](https://github.com/KrisHHFI/Basic-SQL-Tables) and [2](https://github.com/KrisHHFI/Basic-SQL-Tables-2).
- The theme is a fictional commercial building, with different companies occupying each floor. Using SQL I have made relative data tables to represent the different entities.
- In this third part, I have added an employee table. Each employee has some basic information, an ID and the company which they are working for.
- Created using MariaDB, DBeaver and SQL.
